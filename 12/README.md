## Week 12 – Bayesian Methods (28.06.2020)
Gaussian Processes & Bayesian Optimization
- Application: Autonomous labs
- Optimize software parameters, Lizas superres problem
- Robot lab, 2-3 week exercise → too much, maybe in the future

Patrick + Matthias + Luca
- implement a GP + play with it, plot all the functions, etc.
- implement an acquisition function
- implement a sampling strategy
- run it on a hyperparameter optimization of one of the previous excercises
