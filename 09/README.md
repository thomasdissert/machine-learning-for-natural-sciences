## Week 9 â€“ Recurrent neural networks (7.06.2020)
Recurrent neural networks
- Sequence-to-sequence
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Attention
- Application: Reaction prediction, retrosynthesis
- Protein sequences to structure, peptides, there are probably datasets, secondary structure prediction, RNA
- Transformer: https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html
